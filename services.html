                    In Summer, when it’s bright sunny, the outdoor becomes more like a living room. Yeah, why have your lunch inside when you can enjoy it under the sun with the pleasant smell of freshly cut grass with the warming breeze of summer?
                    Warm temperature, bright sky and a sunny day are more than enough to drag you outside. 
                    What if you are planning something fun to do such as lounging or eating? Well if you were, 
                    then it’s high time you reconsider it.  Don’t worry if you are short on
                    space, sometimes just a few inches are enough for the long way.
                    The same applies if you are a bit tight on budget.

                    Just work with what you already have. Don’t worry if you don’t have any garden or even some greenery,
                    it’s not something to fuss about. From yards to porches, we are going to help you for making the most out
                    of your outdoor space. Yes, work with what you already have because you might have no idea what joy it can bring.

                Modern bedrooms are characterised by neutral tones of grey, white and black, all serving as simple, 
                base colours. Walls act as a backdrop to abstract patterns and geometric prints. Lines on furniture are clean, 
                incorporating steel bed frames and side tables. Feature walls are covered in straight striped wallpaper designs,
                 while little splashes of vibrant colours here and there inject visual interest. Accessories are minimal when it 
                 comes to modern designs. Storage is important,
                 and should merge in well with the design of the room, while maintaining adequate functionality.

                Colours enhance your mood, so choosing the right colour for your bedroom can 
                actually improve your sleep pattern. Green and blue are excellent bedroom colours. 
                Lilac has a stress reducing effect, as does white. If you do decide to go for complete white
                walls, incorporating different textures and patterns can add depth and warmth to your bedroom. 
                White bedrooms exemplify style and evoke a peaceful ambience. Incorporating natural textures
                and wood to white bedrooms will prevent your room from looking clinical and cold. 
                Monochrome accents work well with white bedrooms too.

                    While designing your bathroom, it’s a good idea to think about certain key aspects like size, the colours to be used,
                     location of features like sink, shower or bath and the use of natural (or artificial) light. If you children use the
                      bathroom you need to be careful about the use of cleaning agents and other chemicals.
                     Also it is a good idea to add decorative wallpaper or accessories to keep costs low and maintain the aesthetics.
                     Designing a smaller bathroom is always harder than larger spaces, but this should not prevent homeowners from 
                     experimenting with high quality bathroom design. Small bathroom ideas include the 
                     clever use of lighting and colour that will make smaller spaces as welcoming and give the impression of space.

                   Arranging bathroom items smartly can also make smaller bathrooms easy to use. For example, the bath and shower can be
                    combined, while a corner sink can be installed. Using the right bathroom tile ideas can also be a great way to make 
                    the most of a small space, as reflective ceramic tiles can make the room seem much brighter.
                    It needs imagination and hard work but designing a small bathroom is not a Herculean task.Colour is vital when 
                    styling the perfect bathroom. Using the right colour scheme, you can make your bathroom a pleasant place.
                     Dark colour tones such as red and blue can add a luxurious feel and 
                    are advised to use in bigger bathrooms, whereas lighter tones are better for smaller bathrooms.

                    For many people, the dining room is their centrepiece—the place that they entertain guests and share
                     family meals. Because of its importance to the home, it’s important to get the design of any dining room
                      exactly right. All well designed dining rooms pay close attention to the space available. When you are 
                      trying to place tables and chairs, lighting, and storage cabinets, space is a major consideration. Good 
                      designs also show impeccable harmony. Everything works together, from the ceiling lighting to the flooring,
                       to the walls and the table. However, it’s important to note that everyone’s tastes will differ. There is no one
                        perfect dining room,just an endless variety of interior designs that fit the passions of the people they serve.

                   One thing to watch out for when designing any dining room is lighting.
                    The table needs to be lit properly to show off food and dinner placings in their best light, but it might not be so 
                    important to illuminate sideboards or walls, so consider using specially placed lamps that focus on the table.
                     Materials are also important. Dining furniture needs to look good, but it should also be long lasting. Children 
                     can easily damage your beautiful upholstery, and red wine can stain fabrics irretrievably. So consider using
                      materials like wood or composites to ensure durability. Little touches can also make the difference between a
                       bland space and a spectacular design. So think about curtains, flowers and ornaments, but don’t go over the top. 
                       Restraint is important in choosing dining room décor as well.

                    Just about everyone has to bring work home with them at some time, whether that be a stack of paperwork or saved on 
                    a laptop. If you’re not an office worker then perhaps you need a dedicated spot to sort the household bills and 
                    correspondence. Even the kids need a area to sit and concentrate on homework or do computer research. Whatever your
                     needs, the chances are that you need a home office
                     - whether that looks like a complete room, a nook or a pull-out shelf, that’s up to you.

                   A small home office may benefit from having fitted furniture, with a made-to-measure desk and units. 
                   This fitted desk sweeps over the top of a unique trash can , which is available here, to join with a 
                   matching cupboard and bookshelves. A few stylish monochrome prints decorate
                    the free wall space around the window, and a designer table lamp adorns the worktop.
                   A desk can be situated just about anywhere. Behind a sofa is an ideal spot since the length of a sofa 
                   matches the span of a desk.
                    Decorative shelving installed behind the sofa can also work double time as office storage.

                    Brighter colours are making way for neutral tones such as beige, sand and nutty hues. It is increasingly common to 
                    find kids’ rooms entirely created with an earthy, neutral colour scheme in mind, with small strokes of cooler natural
                     greens, greys, and warmer pinks and whites. Increasingly parents opt for such palette for their kids’ rooms.
                      There is little doubt such spaces positively impact their little dwellers by creating a calm and cosy backdrop for play, studies and sleep.

                   Floral patterns in textiles and wallpaper have made a comeback in children’s interior decoration. 
                   Using floral textiles will add character to the room no matter if you aim for sweet romantic look or a more dramatic vintage vibe. For a balanced 
                   and coordinated look layer floral patterns with solid colours and patterns within similar colour palette.
                   Good design is always about both form and function. Many designers are now hard at work creating amazing multi purpose
                   products and furniture. And they are more practical than ever before! Now getting a piece of furniture that grows with your child is easy peasy.

                    Every room should look well put together with the ideal mix of elements. Additionally, the room should 
                    be synergistic with the overall design style of the house. Rather than placing all of one’s favourite furniture and
                     accessories in the room, it’s essential to plan the layout of the space so that each object in the room serves the
                      purpose or beauty or functionality. 
                    The purpose of the room will also determine the design.

                     showcase your design aesthetic by experimenting with color palettes, layers of texture and patterns, and a variety
                      of furniture layouts. It’s meant to be comfortable, inviting, and full of style. Plus, if you’re a design
                       enthusiast, it’s an ideal space in which to put your favorite trends to the test,
                    whether it’s opting for maximalist art or going bold with metallic wall paint.

                    Graphic prints can have major impact in a small space such as a powder room.
                    Layering patterns in a range of styles and scales is an easy way to add visual interest to a room. 
                    If your color choices are usually more reserved, step outside of your comfort zone by choosing a bold hue like purple for a hallway. 
                    Every room can benefit from accessories with a history. Rather than showcasing your collectibles on a shelf,

                    Lighting design plays a key role in creating the right mood and adjusting
                     the ambiance of interior spaces.  Interior designers have different lighting resources that help
                      create functional spaces that can adjust to those specific needs of our clients.
                    Residential interior designers utilize several types of lighting to create the correct 
                    amount of lighting in a room. It is important to understand the use of each type of lighting source available 
                    and which particular need it will satisfy in a successful home lighting plan.

                    General lighting is one of the first layers of lighting used in modern 
                    interior design and refers to the light used for the overall illumination
                    of the space. These types of lighting sources provide basic lighting requirements 
                    to create an accessible space where users can move around easily in a safe way.  
                    Recessed ceiling lights, or overhead ceiling fixtures can meet general lighting needs.
                    General lighting can sometimes be the existing lighting or part of the new lighting design plan.

                   As we move towards less cluttered lives, kitchenettes are playing an 
                   increasingly important role in today’s homes. With a little effort you can have a functional
                   and beautiful kitchenette. In many homes, kitchenettes are used as secondary kitchens in 
                   finished basements, guest spaces or in-law suites. The newest styles are design forward and 
                   super efficient.There are a lot of factors that you need to consider when you plan to design
                   a new kitchen or remodel it. A kitchen is often the hub of the home, so it is very important
                   to get it right, otherwise, it is heartbreaking.
                   Kitchen remodelling needs more thought than picking a few colours and materials.

                    When it's time to choose the colours for your kitchen, make sure you first take a 
                    moment to think about the mission of the kitchen - if you are really looking for
                    excitement or it is the room more for helping you find a sense of peace? If it is a 
                    modern kitchen, do you want it to be your space to invent and conduct experiments -
                    or are you and your family looking for a room that appears to be a great spot for
                    entertaining? The heart of the home, the kitchen, must appeal the tastes of many.
                    When it comes to learning how to paint your home's heart, choosing the right 
                    kitchen colours is everything. Use some spicy, warm kitchen colours, such as red,
                    orange and yellow, that relate to food and offer appetising surroundings. 
                    Use cooler, serene kitchen paint colours like green, blue and violet to create a
                    calm and fresh atmosphere. A simple colour change can definitely 
                    update your kitchen in major ways.

                Architecture, however, is different. A poorly thought-out project will 
                affect the lives of many people consistently and for a long time.
                With interiors, this effect is even more amplified. Humanity is spending
